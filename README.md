# Tic-Tac-Toe
> Tic Tac Toe is made with Tiny Engine 2D framework

## Why?
After I implement the **[Entity Component System](https://github.com/Lohrran/Entity-Component-System)** and **[Tiny Engine 2D](https://github.com/Lohrran/Tiny-Engine-2D)** I need to prove the concept in a real game example, tic tac toe was the perfect simple game to use it.

## Introduction
The game was a prove of concept to use the framework previously created (Tiny Engine 2D)
